              -- drawing new automata (in the Draw tab), loading in existing
              automata (in the Load tab), or generating completely new and
              random automata (in the Random tab) -- and subsequently simulating
              generations of these automata to observe what happens. It is also
              worth noting that simulations on this site use a bounded grid
              rather than an infinite or boundless one (as other applications
              such as Golly might use), and thus boundaries and B0 rules may
              behave slightly differently

              Cellular automata (plural for automaton), are a class of
              mathematical objects that have been used in the fields of
              microstructure modeling, physics, quantum mechanics, and
              theoretical biology (just to name a few). A cellular automaton
              consists of a grid of cells, each of which has a finite set of
              allowed states (such as on/off or alive/dead), and each of which
              also has a neighborhood of other cells that it interacts with. The
              state of the cellular automaton evolves over time, progressing
              through a number of generations. The state of each cell at time{' '}
              <i>t+1</i> depends on the state of each cell at time <i>t</i>, and
              so on, with a specified transition rule that determines how the
              automaton changes based on the states of each cell and
              neighborhood <br />

              subclass of cellular automata that has two dimensions, has two
              states (on/off or alive/dead), uses the{' '}

              automaton, and in fact what this subclass is named after, is
              Conway's Game of Life. This site focuses specifically on lifelike
              cellular automata, of which there exist an incredible amount. For
